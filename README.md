# Behavioral Biometrics-Based Fraud Detection for Digital Payments

This repository contains my individual machine learning contributions to a collaborative research project titled:

**A Multi-Layered Security Framework for Digital Payments: Behavioral Biometrics-Based Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

## Project Description

This research project proposes a multi-layered security framework to enhance digital payment systems by combining behavioral biometrics with machine learning–based fraud detection. The approach focuses on identifying fraudulent activities by analyzing transaction patterns and behavioral deviations from normal user activity.

My contribution to the project focuses on the machine learning layer of the framework. I worked on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development and evaluation of fraud detection models. Specifically, I implemented supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent and anomalous behavior in digital payment transactions.

This repository serves as a companion repository and includes only the machine learning components developed by me as part of the collaborative research work.

## My Contribution

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Development and evaluation of machine learning models:
  - **XGBoost** for transaction-based fraud detection
  - **Isolation Forest** for behavioral anomaly detection
- Model performance evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Collaboration Note

This work is part of a collaborative academic research project.  
The complete system implementation, including APIs and system integration, was developed jointly by the project team.

This repository contains **only the machine learning models and analysis developed by me**.
